# PowerBI-Dashboard HR Analytics
Overview: Created an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize and analyze employee attrition trends and key HR metrics for a company with 1,470 employees. The dashboard highlights factors influencing turnover, such as demographics, job roles, salary, and tenure, to support data-driven HR strategies.
Data Source: Utilized an HR dataset covering 1,470 employees, including details on attrition (237 cases, 16.1% rate), average age (37), salary ($6.5K), and years at the company (7.0). Data segmented by education field, age groups, job roles, salary bands, departments (Human Resources, Research & Development, Sales), and gender.
Key Analyses Performed:
Overall metrics: Total employees, attrition count/rate, averages for age, salary, and tenure.
Attrition by education field (e.g., Life Sciences at 38%, Medical at 27%).
Attrition by age groups (e.g., highest in 26-35 at 116 cases).
Attrition by job role and level (e.g., Laboratory Technician at 62 cases, Sales Executive at 57).
Attrition by salary slabs (e.g., up to $5K at 163 cases).
Attrition by years at company (visualized as a line chart showing trends, with peaks in early years).
Gender and department breakdowns (e.g., male attrition at 123, female at 66; filters for departments like Sales).

Tools and Techniques Used: Power BI for data import, modeling, DAX calculations (e.g., attrition rate, averages), and visualizations including pie charts, bar graphs, line charts, tables, and slicers for interactive filtering by department and gender.
Key Insights and Findings:
High attrition among younger employees (26-35 age group) and lower salary brackets (up to $5K), suggesting retention challenges for entry-level staff.
Roles like Laboratory Technician and Sales Executive experienced the most turnover (62 and 57 cases), while managerial roles had lower rates.
Education fields like Life Sciences and Medical accounted for 65% of attrition, indicating potential skill gaps or dissatisfaction in technical areas.
Attrition decreases with tenure, with early years (0-5) showing higher rates, pointing to onboarding or early-career support needs.
Males had higher attrition (123 vs. 66 for females), with department-specific trends via slicers.

Skills Demonstrated: Data visualization, ETL processes in Power BI, DAX for custom measures, dashboard design for interactivity, and deriving HR insights from raw data.
Outcome: Delivered a user-friendly, interactive dashboard that allows HR teams to drill down into metrics, identify high-risk groups, and track trends over time. This project demonstrates my proficiency in Power BI for transforming HR data into strategic tools for reducing turnover and improving employee satisfaction.
